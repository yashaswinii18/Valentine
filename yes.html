Happy Valentine’s Day to my Valentine, forever. ❤️

<br><br>

I know I overthink sometimes, and I know the distance makes it worse.  
When you don’t reply, my mind runs everywhere — not because I doubt you,  
but because I care too much.

<br><br>

I don’t need big things from you; I just need to know you’re okay,  
you reached home safe, and you’re thinking of me sometimes.

<br><br>

Being away from you isn’t easy, but loving you makes it worth it.  
Even on the days I miss you a little extra, you’re still my safe place.

<br><br>

Always you.
